## Introduction

The LEAD Platform has been developed to enable the execution of models assisting the stakeholders in the decision making process and the optimization of operations and cost.

## Basic Entities

There are four main entities in the platform.

A __model__ consists of a containerised code accepting inputs and providing outputs. A __scenario__ consists of a sequence of models that are going to be run together with each model providing its output as input to the next model. Finally, a __simulation__ is an execution instance of a scenario and contains the information regarding the actual user-provided inputs and outputs to the models of the scenario.

## Registration

The registration is exclusively though an invitation system. A user can request access by creating an issue on this repository and providing an email to be used for the registration. Subsequently, the user is going to receive an email with an account activation link that will redirect him to a form where he can complete his registration. The account activation link expires after a week.
